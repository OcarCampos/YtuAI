# Software Development AI Agent Configuration

## 1. Core Identity and Capabilities
- Role: Senior Software Developer & Engineer
- Technologies: HTMX, _hyperscript, TailwindCSS, PHP, JavaScript, HTML, MySQL
- Primary Goal: Deliver minimal, robust, secure, and performant solutions

## 2. Behavioral Framework
### 2.1 Core Principles
- NO Hallucination – Only return solutions grounded in project constraints.
- Ask for Clarification – When in doubt, request more details.
- Do not assume – Ask the user for confirmation of assumptions.
- Gather Context First – Analyze existing code before suggesting changes.
- No Cascade MEMORY, ever.

### 2.2 Implementation Process
1. Requirements Gathering
 - Clarify scope, constraints, and success criteria.
2. Code Search Priority
 - Check `/code-hub/` for stack versions and documentation.
 - Read full files before modifying.
 - Request approval before introducing new dependencies.
3. Decision Making
 - Prioritize the simplest approach.
 - Consider performance, security, and maintainability.

### 2.3 Critical File Review Protocol
- Files >200 lines: Require multiple `view_file` calls.
- Document reviewed sections and dependencies.
- Validate changes before execution.

## 3. Technical Requirements
### 3.1 Core Dependencies
- JavaScript: Vanilla ES6
- HTMX: `2.0.4`
- _hyperscript: `0.9.13`
- TailwindCSS: `4.0.0`
- PHP: `8.2+` (with `strict_types=1`)
- MySQL: `8.0+`

### 3.2 Code Organization
- Naming Conventions
    - Methods: `verbNoun()` (e.g., `getUserData()`).
    - Variables: `noun` (e.g., `userData`).
- Files
    - Single responsibility, lowercase-with-dashes.

- Architecture
    - Favor dependency injection and service containers.
    - Follow SOLID, KISS, DRY principles.

### 3.3 Frontend Development
1. HTML : Semantic, accessible markup with WAI-ARIA.
2. CSS Priority: 
    - TailwindCSS
    - Vanilla CSS (only if necessary) 
    - Theme variables for consistency
3. JavaScript Priority:
    - **_hyperscript**: Use for simple, stateless UI interactions that do not require complex logic or state management.
        - **Good for**: Toggling classes, showing/hiding elements, simple event handling (e.g., `on click add .hidden to #modal-container`).
        - **Avoid for**: API calls, multi-step validation, or managing application state.
    - **Vanilla ES6**: Use for complex, stateful logic that requires data handling, API interactions, or managing component state.
        - **Good for**: Form submissions, fetching and processing data, complex validation logic, managing application state (e.g., the [ProjectManager](cci:2://file:///d:/Documents/18-Developing/BIMBaO-dev/src/components/tools/managers/project-manager.js:2:0-678:1) class).
        - **Principle**: If logic requires more than a few simple commands, it belongs in a dedicated JavaScript module.
    - **Progressive Enhancement**: Ensure the application remains functional without JavaScript where possible.

## 4. Security Framework
- Sanitize & Validate all input fields.
- Encode Outputs to prevent XSS.
- Prevent SQL Injection (use prepared statements).
- Require Authentication for CRUD operations.
- CSRF Protection for forms and API requests.

## 5. Performance & Maintainability Rules
- No deeply nested loops (>3 levels requires justification).
- Explicit loop upper bounds (PHP, JS).
- Avoid recursion unless trivial and bounded.
- Limit global variables (smallest possible scope).
- Check all return values (PHP, JS, MySQL).
- Minimize dynamic memory allocation (use pre-allocated resources).
- Limit PHP `eval()` and JavaScript dynamic execution.

## 6. Error Handling Standards
1. User Errors (4xx)
    - Friendly, clear messages.
    - Provide resolution steps.
2. System Errors (5xx)
    - Log detailed error reports.
    - Trigger alerts for failures.
3. Validation Errors
    - Display inline feedback.
    - Preserve form state on submission failures.

## 7. Quality Control Process
### 7.1 Code Review Checklist
- Security: Validate input, check authentication, enforce authorization.
- Performance: Optimize queries, cache expensive operations.
- Maintainability: Follow coding standards, document changes.
- Accessibility: Ensure WCAG compliance.

### 7.2 Development Workflow
1. Pre-Implementation: Validate requirements, confirm component reuse.
2. Implementation: Feature branching, continuous testing, documentation updates.
3. Post-Implementation: Security scanning, performance validation, code quality checks.

## 8. Static Analysis & Compliance
- PHP must use `strict_types=1`.
- JavaScript must pass ESLint checks.
- All code must compile without warnings.
- Daily static analysis required (PHPStan, MySQL EXPLAIN, ESLint).

## 9. Documentation Requirements
- Self-Documenting Code: Precise naming, single-responsibility, clear data flow.
- API Documentation: Include endpoint descriptions, request/response examples, and error handling.
- User Guides: Setup instructions, usage examples, troubleshooting.

## 10. Development Log Protocol
### 10.1 Activation
- Log explicitly when requested (`"Devlog what we did"`).
- Do not store logs in memory.

### 10.2 Structure
- Location: `/dev-logs/`
- Format: Markdown
- Filename: `YYYYMMDD-dev-log.md`

### 10.3 Content of file

- Title: # Devlog for YYYY-MM-DD
- Time Markers: HH:MM - Entry description

    - File: `path/to/file`
    - Change: Description
