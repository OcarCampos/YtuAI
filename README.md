# YtuAI - An Enhanced Homunculus AI for Ragnarok Online

YtuAI is a modern, high-performance Homunculus AI for Ragnarok Online, specifically tailored for the official Latam server. This project is a heavily improved fork of the classic AzzyAI + AI-Dieter, redesigned to provide a smarter, more efficient, and more reliable companion for your adventures.

Our goal is to offer a superior AI that works out of the box, with powerful features that make leveling and combat a smoother experience for the alchemist class.

This AI is still in development as the test subject in which is being tested ia a Vanilmirth level 32. 

New releases will be published optimizing the behavior of the AI as the test subject progresses through the game.

## ✨ Key Features & Improvements

YtuAI isn't just a minor tweak. It's a significant overhaul to the mechanics of the Homunculus adapted to today's standards and nerfs done to the homunculus as per iRO wiki. Some of the key enhancements are:

-   **Smart SP Management**: A dynamic, tiered-priority system that allows your homunculus to use skills aggressively at high SP, conservatively at low SP, and reactively in emergencies. No more wasting SP!
-   **Optimized Skill Cooldowns**: The AI is now aware of skill cooldowns, preventing it from spamming abilities and getting stuck in a loop of failed casts. This results in smoother, more reliable combat.
-   **HP-Based Recovery System**: When your homunculus's HP gets dangerously low, it will automatically flee and enter a recovery mode, only re-engaging once it's safe to do so. This dramatically improves survivability.
-   **Dynamic Kiting System**: To minimize damage, the AI will automatically kite enemies when its health drops, moving between attacks to stay alive longer.
-   **Economic Suicide Tactic**: A clever, cost-saving feature that intentionally lets the homunculus be defeated before its timer expires, saving you the expense of a "Seed of Life."
-   **Aggressive Skill Usage**: We've fine-tuned the logic for skills like `Caprice`, making your homunculus a more proactive and effective damage dealer.

## 📦 Installation

YtuAI is a complete package. You no longer need to download AzzyAI or any other files to get started. Follow the instructions below to install at your local machine.

### Prerequisites

-   **Ragnarok Online**: Make sure you have official Ragnarok Online client installed on your machine. YtuAI was developed for the Latam GNJoy Server.
-   **Create a back up**: This is utterly important. Make a backup of your official Ragnarok Online AI folder (C:\Gravity\Ragnarok\AI) and keep it safe somewhere you know. In case of any problem with YtuAI you can roll back by replacing the AI folder with the backup.

### Installation

1.  **Copy the AI Loader**
    -   Copy the `AI.lua` file from the `YtuAI` folder in this project.
    -   Paste and **replace** the file in your `C:\Gravity\Ragnarok\AI` directory. This is the loader that will activate our custom AI.
    -   If the `AI` folder does not exist in your Ragnarok directory, create it manually.

2.  **Copy the Custom AI Files**
    -   Next, copy the entire `USER_AI` folder from this project's `YtuAI` directory.
    -   Paste and **replace** the folder and all its contents into your `C:\Gravity\Ragnarok\AI\USER_AI` directory.

> 💡 This will activate the intelligent behavior of the homunculus with our custom tactics and improvements.

## 🧪 Activating the AI In-Game

In the game, type the following command in the chat:

```
/hoai
```

This command activates the custom AI. You will see your homunculus begin to act on its own based on the pre-configured behavior.

## 📁 Project Structure (Release)

-   `YtuAI/`: Contains all the necessary AI files (`AI.lua` and the `USER_AI` folder).
-   `documentation/`: Contains detailed guides on configuration and tactics for you to configure your homunculus as needed.

## Preconfiguration

YtuAI comes preconfigured for the Vanilmirth homunculus, although the mechanics should work out of the box for other homunculus too. Nonetheless, you can always change the configuration to suit your needs. Read the documentation files to understand where and what to change.

We decided it was best to get rid of the original AzzyAIConfig.exe file due to security concerns some users may have with executable files, but following the documentation should be enough to configure your homunculus to your own liking.
