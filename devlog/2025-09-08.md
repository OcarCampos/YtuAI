# Devlog for 2025-09-08

## Session Summary

This session focused on a comprehensive overhaul of the VanilAI project, including codebase cleanup, implementing new features, and creating thorough documentation. All tasks from the previous devlog have been completed.

## Changes Made

### 1. Project Initialization & Cleanup

-   **Directory Renamed**: The root project folder `AI-dieter` was renamed to `VanilAI` to better reflect the project's focus.
-   **File Review & Headers**: All `.lua` files in the `USER_AI` directory were reviewed. Standardized headers were added to each file to clarify its purpose and context within the project.
-   **Redundant Files Deleted**: Several obsolete files were removed to clean up the codebase, including `Changelog.txt`, `Mob_ID.lua`, old backup configs, and mercenary-specific files that were unused.
-   **`README.md` Updated**: The main `README.md` was updated with a new, simplified installation guide.

### 2. AI Behavior Enhancements

-   **Suicide Tactic Enabled**: The `EnableSuicideTactic` was turned on in `H_Config.lua` for testing.
-   **Caprice Skill Logic**: The logic for the Vanilmirth's `Caprice` skill in `H_Skills.lua` was modified. The `min_mob_count` condition was removed, making the skill's use dependent only on SP. This should result in more aggressive and consistent skill usage.
-   **HP-Based Recovery System**: A new flee-and-recover system was implemented.
    -   Added a `RecoverHP` setting to `H_Config.lua`.
    -   Modified `AI_main.lua` to make the homunculus enter a passive recovery mode after fleeing, only re-engaging in combat once its HP is above the `RecoverHP` threshold.

### 3. Documentation & Project Rules

-   **New Documentation Created**: A new, comprehensive documentation file was created at `documentation/VanilAI_Documentation.md`. It includes sections on installation, file structure, configuration, and core AI systems.
-   **`windsurfrules` Updated**: The project's `windsurfrules` file was completely replaced with a new set of rules tailored for a Lua-based AI project, providing better context for future development.

## Next Steps

-   The AI is now ready for a testing phase to ensure all new features are working as expected and that no regressions were introduced.
-   Awaiting feedback from testing before proceeding with the next development cycle.
