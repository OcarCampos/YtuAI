# Devlog for 2025-09-13

## Session Summary

Focused on fixing the Economic Suicide Tactic (SUICIDE_ST) functionality, which was not working properly. The homunculus was not entering suicide mode after the configured time threshold, continuing to engage in normal combat behavior instead.

## Root Cause Analysis

After thorough investigation of the codebase, we identified the root cause of the SUICIDE_ST functionality not working:

1. **SummonTick Reset Between Sessions**: The `SummonTick` variable was being reinitialized every time the game was restarted, causing the timer to reset. This meant the homunculus would never reach the configured suicide time threshold unless it was summoned and left active for the full duration in a single game session.

2. **No Persistence Mechanism**: There was no mechanism to store the original summon time across game sessions, so the AI couldn't track how long the homunculus had actually been alive.

3. **Debug Visibility**: There was no logging or debugging for the suicide functionality, making it difficult to diagnose issues.

## Changes Made

1. **Implemented Persistence for SummonTick**:
   - Modified `UpdateTimeoutFile()` to include the `SummonTick` value when saving state variables
   - Updated the timeout file format to store the original summon time
   - This allows the AI to track how long the homunculus has been alive across game sessions

2. **Updated Initialization Logic**:
   - Modified `doInit()` to load timeouts before initializing `SummonTick`
   - Only initialize `SummonTick` if it's not found in the timeout file
   - This ensures the original summon time is preserved across sessions

3. **Enhanced the Loading Mechanism**:
   - Completely rewrote the `loadtimeouts()` function to safely handle loading the `SummonTick` value
   - Added proper error handling and logging for the loading process
   - Used a sandboxed environment to prevent global variable conflicts

4. **Added Comprehensive Debugging**:
   - Added detailed logging to track the suicide timer calculation
   - Added logging for `SummonTick` initialization and loading
   - Enhanced the `OnSUICIDE_ST` function with additional logging
   - Created a direct file logging mechanism as a backup

## Testing Instructions

To test the fixed functionality:

1. **For Current Homunculus**: Since the current homunculus has already been summoned and the original summon time wasn't saved, you should:
   - Kill the current homunculus
   - Summon a new one with the updated code
   - This will ensure the `SummonTick` is properly initialized and saved

2. **Verification Process**:
   - After summoning the new homunculus, check the logs to confirm `SummonTick` is initialized
   - Log out and back in to verify `SummonTick` is loaded correctly from the timeout file
   - Wait for the configured time (or temporarily reduce `SuicideTimer` for testing) to verify the suicide functionality triggers

## Next Steps

1. **Monitor Performance**: Observe the homunculus behavior to ensure the suicide functionality works correctly across game sessions

2. **Consider Additional Enhancements**:
   - Add a command to manually trigger the suicide mode for testing
   - Implement a visual indicator when the homunculus is approaching its suicide time
   - Add configuration options for more granular control over the suicide behavior

## Feedback

The implementation should now correctly track the homunculus's lifetime across game sessions and trigger the suicide functionality at the appropriate time. Please test and provide feedback on the behavior.
