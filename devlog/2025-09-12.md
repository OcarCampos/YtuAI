# Devlog for 2025-09-12

## Session Summary

Addressing the key feedback points from the last extensive playtest.

1.  **Correcting Smart SP Management**: The "Balanced" SP strategy is currently being skipped. We will investigate and fix the logic to ensure all three tiers (Aggressive, Balanced, Conservative) are used correctly.
2.  **Tuning HP-Based Recovery**: The homunculus is re-engaging in combat before reaching the designated `RecoverHP` threshold. We will adjust the recovery logic to enforce the proper safety buffer.
3.  **Fixing Skill Cooldowns**: The `Caprice` skill is being spammed, ignoring its cooldown. We will diagnose and fix the cooldown implementation to ensure efficient skill casting.
4.  **Reviewing Legacy `Aggro` Settings**: The original `AggroHP` and `AggroSP` parameters may be conflicting with the new recovery systems. We will analyze their interaction and neutralize any interference.
5.  **Refactoring the Economic Suicide Tactic**: The current suicide logic is not behaving as intended. We will refactor this feature into a dedicated `SUICIDAL_ST` state with a more reliable attack-idle pattern.
6.  **Implementing Auto-Buff Feature**: As a new enhancement, we will add logic to auto-cast `Chaotic Blessings` when the homunculus and owner are idle.

## Changes Made

- **Refactored SP Management Logic**:
    - Identified a conflict where the legacy `AggroSP` variable was preventing the new Smart SP tiered logic from functioning correctly. The old check would make the AI passive before the "Balanced" or "Conservative" tiers could be used.
    - Removed all logic related to `AggroSP` from [AI_main.lua](../YtuAI/USER_AI/AI_main.lua) to ensure that the decision to find a target is no longer dependent on SP. This gives the `ChooseSkill` engine full control over resource management during combat.
    - Commented out the `AggroSP` definition in [H_Config.lua](../YtuAI/USER_AI/H_Config.lua) to complete its removal from the active codebase.
    - Corrected the `min_sp_pct` condition in [H_Skills.lua](../YtuAI/USER_AI/H_Skills.lua) by commenting it out, allowing the dynamic `priority` function to be the single source of truth for skill-casting decisions based on SP.

- **Neutralized Legacy `AttackSkillReserveSP`**:
    - Investigated the legacy `AttackSkillReserveSP` variable and confirmed it operates on a conflicting, flat-value SP reservation system.
    - To prevent conflicts with the new tiered SP logic, its usage in [AzzyUtil.lua](../YtuAI/USER_AI/AzzyUtil.lua) was modified to return `0`, effectively disabling the check.
    - The variable definition was then commented out in [H_Config.lua](../YtuAI/USER_AI/H_Config.lua) to complete its removal from the active logic.

- **Tuned HP-Based Recovery Logic**:
    - Fixed an issue where the homunculus would re-engage in combat immediately after reaching the `RecoverHP` threshold, without a safety buffer.
    - Added a `return` statement in the `OnIDLE_ST` recovery check in [AI_main.lua](../YtuAI/USER_AI/AI_main.lua). This forces the AI to wait for one full AI cycle after recovery is complete before it can search for new targets, ensuring it doesn't jump back into a fight prematurely.

- **Removed Legacy `AggroHP` Variable**:
    - Assessed the legacy `AggroHP` variable and confirmed it was made redundant by the modern `FleeHP`/`RecoverHP` system.
    - Removed all logic dependent on `AggroHP` from [AI_main.lua](../YtuAI/USER_AI/AI_main.lua) to simplify the aggression checks.
    - Commented out the `AggroHP` definition in [H_Config.lua](../YtuAI/USER_AI/H_Config.lua) to finalize its removal. This makes the new recovery system the single source of truth for HP-based safety.

- **Fixed Skill Cooldown System**:
    - Identified a disconnect between the cooldown logic and the skill selection process that was causing Caprice to be spammed.
    - Integrated cooldown checks directly into the `ChooseSkill()` function in [AzzyUtil.lua](../YtuAI/USER_AI/AzzyUtil.lua) to prevent skills on cooldown from being selected.
    - Moved the cooldown formula for Caprice to [H_Skills.lua](../YtuAI/USER_AI/H_Skills.lua) as a `cooldown` property, making it part of the skill definition.
    - Replaced the Caprice-specific cooldown setting in [AI_main.lua](../YtuAI/USER_AI/AI_main.lua) with a generic approach that works for any skill with a defined cooldown formula.
    - Removed the redundant cooldown check that happened after skill selection, ensuring a more efficient and maintainable codebase.

- **Improved Economic Suicide Tactic**:
    - Completely redesigned the suicide tactic to implement a more effective pattern of behavior.
    - Added a sub-state system within the `SUICIDE_ST` state to control the homunculus's actions:
        - `SUICIDE_ATTACK_SUBSTATE`: Find a target and perform a single attack
        - `SUICIDE_WAIT_SUBSTATE`: Wait for 10 seconds before attacking again
    - Implemented a more robust targeting system that uses the existing enemy selection logic.
    - Added fallback behavior to find any monster if no valid targets are found through normal targeting.
    - For Vanilmirth homunculi, implemented a specific weak attack using Caprice level 1 to avoid killing monsters.
    - Added detailed logging to track the suicide behavior for easier debugging.
    - Added proper initialization of suicide state variables when entering suicide mode.
    - **Note**: The current implementation includes Vanilmirth-specific code for using Caprice level 1. This will need to be expanded in the future to support other homunculus types and mercenaries with appropriate weak attacks.
