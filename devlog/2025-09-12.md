# Devlog for 2025-09-12

## Session Summary

Addressing the key feedback points from the last extensive playtest.

1.  **Correcting Smart SP Management**: The "Balanced" SP strategy is currently being skipped. We will investigate and fix the logic to ensure all three tiers (Aggressive, Balanced, Conservative) are used correctly.
2.  **Tuning HP-Based Recovery**: The homunculus is re-engaging in combat before reaching the designated `RecoverHP` threshold. We will adjust the recovery logic to enforce the proper safety buffer.
3.  **Fixing Skill Cooldowns**: The `Caprice` skill is being spammed, ignoring its cooldown. We will diagnose and fix the cooldown implementation to ensure efficient skill casting.
4.  **Reviewing Legacy `Aggro` Settings**: The original `AggroHP` and `AggroSP` parameters may be conflicting with the new recovery systems. We will analyze their interaction and neutralize any interference.
5.  **Refactoring the Economic Suicide Tactic**: The current suicide logic is not behaving as intended. We will refactor this feature into a dedicated `SUICIDAL_ST` state with a more reliable attack-idle pattern.
6.  **Implementing Auto-Buff Feature**: As a new enhancement, we will add logic to auto-cast `Chaotic Blessings` when the homunculus and owner are idle.
